                    <p>Collaborating with my professor, we are reading the original research paper paragraph by paragraph and implementing each part to ensure a fully functional program like theirs, ultimately developing an effective solution for the attack.</p>

                <h3>Dungeons and Dragons Discord Bot - In Progress</h3>
                <p>Currently in development, this project caters to the D&D community on Discord. Upon completion, it will offer robust features, including character, monster, and item creation, inventory management, spell tracking, and ability monitoring. Additional functionalities encompass dice rolling, integration with ChatGPT and DALL-E, and incorporation of sound effects.</p>

                    <p>Collaborating with two dedicated colleagues, we are diligently dividing responsibilities for an efficient workflow. Reflecting on our prior bot project, we identified its shortcomings and opted for a new, dedicated bot to ensure a more organized and functional outcome.</p>

                <p>This program was a part of my research on the Bernstein-Vazirani Quantum Algorithm. The research argued that rather than using the commonly employed Deutsch algorithm to teach quantum computing, it's more beneficial to utilize the Bernstein-Vazirani Algorithm. This approach is less abstract, making it easier for undergraduate students to grasp.</p>

                <p>This project marks the successful culmination of our team's inaugural attempt at creating a Discord bot. While not designed for a specific purpose, it served as a fun and educational endeavor. We implemented fifteen commands, with our proudest achievement being the successful implementation of data storage.</p>
                <div class="details">
                    <p>Developed during our spare time, this project, created in collaboration with two friends, presented unique challenges. Overcoming hurdles such as saving user data and effectively utilizing reactions in chats were significant milestones. The data storage solution was devised in the winter of 2021, and insights from this project influenced the development of our subsequent D&D bot.</p>
